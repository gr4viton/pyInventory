[PEXMCU-1001] Wrong value of Heapsize in board support project
changed the heapsize value to 
0400 = 0x400 = 1024dec

Now every board supported derivate has non-zero heapsize.

[PEx_CW_MCU_REL] #415114
[PEx_KSDK_1_1_GA_review] #415115


____________________________________________________
All boards of the list now have:
* new [user signal name] paradigm
* cpu frequency settings 
* joined one .peb file for both cpu and pinsettings
* edited wizard xml file to load the right peb

PEXCORE-761

    In Clock Configuration Component
    after you create [Configuration description] i.e "asd"
    hit save (just for sure)
    do some other change in component (i.e change some clock frequency value)
    hit [Edit -> Undo] or control+Z
        both changes are removed (clock and description)
    hit [Edit -> Redo] or control+shift+Z
        only clock change was recreated
    [Configuration description] changed into default value and stayed there

[PEXMCU-1445] Default heap size in PEBs should be zero
[PEXMCU-1210] re-save peb files
[PEXMCU-1238] When CPU has USB - USB must be default config in BSP

For boards:
    FRDM-K22F 
    FRDM-K64F 
    TWR-K22F120M 
    TWR-K64F120M

    TWR-K60D100M
    FRDM-KL46Z
    FRDM-KL03Z
    TWR-K24F120M

with SDK support

 * Resaved the old-good and right clock configurations, into the new style 
  - moved from [CPU] component into [Clock Manager] component
 * Restored zero size value of HeapSize in [CPU] component
  - HeapSize = 0000
 * Recreated the right user-signal names in pinsettings 
  - manually (by a script) copied old-good user names over the default MCU ones
 * On the way changed default Clock configuration to USB if it is present
